## Introduction:
Tracking Systems nowadays are in high demand starting from the very basic attendance systems to most critical security systems. With the powerful rise of AI & Computer Vision. These Tracking Systems have become more accurate & more precise resulting in more reliability and stability. 
Our Project is basically Leveraging The power of Image & Video Detection, Recognition & Tracking. 
We have applied the best-in-class Computer Vision Algorithms to Build a full Attendance Tracking System Enabling the following Features: 
- Real Time Face Detection & Recognition applied on Video Camera Streams. “Based on your    Computational Resources Power”
- Ability to Add new Employees to the System and Retrain the Algorithm Using Only 1~2 Images. 
- A Web Application Showing Employees Attendance & Activities.
- Extras: Faces Detector & Recognizer
